def network_dfs(adjacency, root, callback=None):
    """
    Return all nodes of a connected component containing 'root' of a network
    represented by an adjacency dictionary.

    This implementation uses a 'to visit' stack. The principle of a stack
    is LIFO. In Python, a list is a stack.

    Initially only the root element is on the stack. While there are still
    elements on the stack, the node on top of the stack is 'popped off' and if
    this node was not already visited, its neighbours are added to the stack if
    they hadn't already been visited themselves.

    Since the last element on top of the stack is always popped off, the
    algorithm goes deeper and deeper in the datastructure, until it reaches a
    node without (unvisited) neighbours and then backtracks. Once a new node
    with unvisited neighbours is found, there too it will go as deep as possible
    before backtracking again, and so on. Once there are no more nodes on the
    stack, the entire structure has been traversed.

    Note that this returns a depth-first spanning tree of a connected component
    of the network.

    Parameters:
        adjacency (dict): An adjacency dictionary. Each key represents a vertex
            and maps to a list of neighbouring vertex keys.
        root (str): The vertex from which to start the depth-first search.
        callback (callable): Optional. A function that is called on every node
            when it is found. Default is ``None``.

    Returns:
        list: A depth-first ordering of all vertices in the network.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the callback is provided, but is not callable.

    Examples:
        >>> import compas
        >>> network = Network.from_obj(compas.get_data('lines.obj'))
        >>> print(network_dfs(network, network.get_any_vertex()))

def network_bfs(adjacency, root, callback=None):
    """Return all nodes of a connected component containing 'root' of a network

    This implementation uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit.
    The principle of a queue is FIFO. In Python, a deque (double-ended queue) is
    ideal for removing elements from the beginning, i.e. from the 'left'.

    In a breadth-first search, all unvisited neighbours of a node are visited
    first. When a neighbour is visited, its univisited neighbours are added to
    the list of nodes to visit.

    Parameters:
        adjacency (dict): An adjacency dictionary. Each key represents a vertex
            and maps to a list of neighbouring vertex keys.
        root (str): The vertex from which to start the breadth-first search.

    Examples:
        >>> import compas
        >>> network = Network.from_obj(compas.get_data('lines.obj'))

    Notes:
        By appending the neighbours to the end of the list of nodes to visit,
        and by visiting the nodes at the start of the list first, the network is
        traversed in *breadth-first* order.
